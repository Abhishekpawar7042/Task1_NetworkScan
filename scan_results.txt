Nmap scan report for 191.168.1.x
Host is up (0.0037s latency).
Not shown: 995 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT    STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp  filtered ssh
23/tcp  filtered telnet
53/tcp  open     domain
80/tcp  open     http
443/tcp open     https
MAC Address: 6C:4F:89:28:4A:08 (Unknown)

Open Ports:
-22/tcp  ssh
   • Risk: Possible brute-force or unauthorized access if weak/default credentials are used.
   • Severity: Medium
   • Evidence: scan_result1.txt
   • Mitigation: Disable password auth, use key-based login, restrict SSH to admin IPs via firewall, enable fail2ban.
   
-23/TCP – Telnet
   .Risk: Unencrypted remote access; credentials can be intercepted; could allow unauthorized system control.
   .Severity: High
   .Evidence: scan_result1.txt
   .Mitigation: Disable Telnet; use SSH (port 22) instead; restrict access via firewall; monitor for suspicious login attempts.
   
-53/udp  dns
   • Risk: Open resolver can be used for amplification DDoS; misconfig may allow cache poisoning or AXFR.
   • Severity: Medium - High
   • Evidence: scan_result1.txt
   • Mitigation: Disable recursion for external clients; restrict AXFR; rate-limit queries; firewall 53.

-80/tcp  http
   • Risk: Vulnerable web application could lead to data leak, defacement, or remote code execution.
   • Severity: Medium
   • Evidence: scan_result1.txt
   • Mitigation: Remove default pages, update web applications, run web vulnerability scan, consider WAF.
   • Notes: Version/details of web app not determined.

-443/tcp https
   • Risk: Misconfigured TLS or vulnerable web app might expose sensitive data or allow exploits.
   • Severity: Medium
   • Evidence: scan_result1.txt
   • Mitigation: Ensure up-to-date TLS config, use HSTS, patch web apps, scan for vulnerabilities.

.Mitigation: Restrict access to management VLAN; use VPN or jump host; enable strong authentication; firewall port 902.

912/TCP – VMware Authentication Service (vSphere Client/VMware Tools)
.Risk: Exposed port could allow information disclosure or authentication bypass if misconfigured.
.Severity: Medium
.Evidence: scan_result1.txt
.Mitigation: Restrict access to trusted networks; monitor logs; disable if not needed.

3306/TCP – MySQL Database
.Risk: Open MySQL port may allow unauthorized database access, data leakage, SQL injection attempts.
.Severity: High
.Evidence: scan_result1.txt
.Mitigation: Restrict access to trusted hosts; enforce strong passwords; disable remote root login; enable TLS; firewall port 3306.
